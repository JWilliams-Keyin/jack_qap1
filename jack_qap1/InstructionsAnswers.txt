1. It took me over a week to get a design going for the website, I stressed over it a lot as I 
usually do with more creative tasks. Once I managed to get an idea of what the website would
look like, it took me about an hour to research the brand, and another 8 or 9 to write the
HTML and CSS, which was mostly writing and re-writing things to get them to work.

2. I had to look back at some recordings of classes to find answers to some problems I was
having, as well as the GitHub repository. As for my sources, I used the official website for
the car I chose along with Shutterstock for pictures, YouTube for a video and Spotify for
figures on the band in related media.

3. I didn't end up asking for help, although if I had started coding sooner I would have tried
to keep some of the more advanced features I was hoping to add. I likely would have asked for
assistance on them if I had begun coding them a few days before.

4. Same as number 3

5. This isn't that hard objectively, but HTML is my weakest subject so far in the course, I much
prefer Python and JS as I don't have a creative mind and making things look pretty stresses me
out. For me, this was an 8 out of 10 difficulty project. If I had started the coding earlier 
I would have had less stress on my end for sure, but I doubt I could have done much better in 
a similar situation aside from getting more time to troubleshoot.
