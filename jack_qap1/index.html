            The <dfn>De Tomaso</dfn> Pantera was made in partnership with Ford. 
            It was intended to be a direct competitor to cars like the Chevrolet Corvette. 
            The car would be made by De Tomaso, while Ford would contribute with their V8 engines. 
            Both companies were responsible for sale of the vehicle in different regions. 
            Ford would sell the Pantera in the US and Canada, while De Tomaso Automobili handled 
            sales in other areas. The car launched in North America in 1970, but never managed to 
            out-sell the Corvette, and imports of the Pantera to America were cancelled in 1974.
